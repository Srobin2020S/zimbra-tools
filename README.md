# Zimbra Community Tools

This is an assortment of tools for various administrative tasks for the Zimbra
 Collaboration Suite.
  
These tools are currently available:

## Kickstart file for automatic creation of Zimbra 8.7 repo mirror
This kickstart file automates this wiki: https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository

You can create your repo using KVM by doing something similar to: https://github.com/Zimbra-Community/pgp-zimlet/blob/stable/kvm/virt-install.sh or you can start the kickstart with a CentOS7 install ISO. After installation you only need to copy your SSL key and crt file to the new server.

## pull.sh

Download all repositories in Zimbra-Community, bash -x pull.sh

## zmmboxsearchx for Zimbra foss
The CLI command zmmboxsearchx is used to search across mailboxes. You can search across mailboxes to find messages and attachments that match specific criteria and save copies of these messages to a directory. Created by Phil Pearl as part of bug 43265.

This tool is a bit buggy, if it fails, trying again usually does the trick. 

    zmmboxsearchx --query admin --account admin@myzimbra.com,test@myzimbra.com

    wget https://github.com/Zimbra-Community/zimbra-tools/raw/master/alien-8.95/zmmboxsearchx-20100625-2.noarch.rpm
    rpm -i zmmboxsearchx-20100625-2.noarch.rpm
    -or-
    wget https://github.com/Zimbra-Community/zimbra-tools/raw/master/alien-8.95/zmmboxsearchx.deb
    dpkg -i zmmboxsearchx.deb

Example: `zmmboxsearchx --query admin --account testuser3@myzimbra.com,admin@myzimbra.com,test@myzimbra.com`
